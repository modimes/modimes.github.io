      <p>
        Walking down the road with wide open eyes<br />
        Picking up diamonds and gold<br />
        Where ever I went<br />
        I owned the world
      </p>
      <p>
        As I kept growing the sky would dim<br />
        And girls started to glow<br />
        One was shining so bright<br />
        I got lost in the flow
      </p>
      <p>
        Then she was showing me<br />
        Things I didn't know<br />
        And one day<br />
        She had to move on
      </p>
      <p>
        And then somehow calmed the water<br />
        And somehow life went on
      </p>
      <p>
        Later on I was playing in bands<br />
        And the fortune wheel started to spin<br />
        Just never slowed down<br />
        And I didn't win
      </p>
      <p>
        Girls would smile at me<br />
        Where ever I turned<br />
        But in the end<br />
        We always got burned
      </p>
      <p>
        And then somehow calmed the water<br />
        And somehow life went on
      </p>
      <p>
        Walking down the road with wide open eyes<br />
        Picking up diamonds and gold<br />
        I still sometimes seem to own the world
      </p>
      <p>
        And then somehow calmed the water<br />
        And somehow life went on

      <p>
        The middle of the night<br />
        The world is sleeping tight<br />
        Suddenly I am wide awake
      </p>
      <p>
        Find myself asleep<br />
        Moving like a thief<br />
        I know it's real<br />
        It's not a dream
      </p>
      <p>
        Seems someone's at the door<br />
        Says: 'whatcha waiting for?<br />
        I'm waiting for you!'<br />
        Maybe it's up to me<br />
        To open up and see<br />
        Finally what's new
      </p>
      <p>
        The hallway is flying by<br />
        The other room, I'm getting high<br />
        See myself at the age of five
      </p>
      <p>
        Something is dragging me<br />
        Back to the hallway I wanna see<br />
        What it is, something is going on
      </p>
      <p>
        Seems someone's at the door<br />
        Says: 'whatcha waiting for?<br />
        I'm waiting for you!'<br />
        Maybe it's up to me<br />
        To open up and see<br />
        Finally what's new
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it might be him<br />
        The master from within<br />
        Is calling for me<br />
        Or it's Aquarius<br />
        You know, there's various possibilities

        Everybody grooving<br />
        What you got you're shaking<br />

        Early in the morning<br />

        Love is all around<br />
        Celebrating Summertime

      <p>
        But it's you I've been watching all night<br />
        You made me feel alright<br />
        You made me forget my name

      <p>
        Happy people laughing<br />
        Worrying 'bout nothing<br />

        Slowly we are sinking<br />
        In a sea of gladness<br />

      <p>
        Met a woman the other night<br />
        Her body was made of light<br />
        And she was floating in the air
      </p>
      <p>
        Spoke to me in a silent voice<br />
        Giant whisper without a noise<br />
        And all I saw her do was smile
      </p>
      <p>
        She asked me:<br />
        'Have you seen the city burn,<br />
        Do you think you'll ever learn<br />
        To treat a brother the way you should?'
      </p>
      <p>
        'Cause it's up to you and me<br />
        To leave the dark behind<br />
        It will be you and me<br />
        Who'll let love shine
      </p>
      <p>
        When the light would hurt my eyes<br />
        I came to realize<br />
        I was given another precious day
      </p>
      <p>
        So I decided to always smile<br />
        It just lasted a little while<br />
        But I will somehow find a way
      </p>
      <p>
        'Cause it's on you and me<br />
        To leave the dark behind<br />
        It will be you and me<br />
        Who'll let love shine
      </p>
      <p>
        It's up to you and me<br />

        Have you ever felt that you're alone<br />
        Were you sad because<br />
        You've been on your own<br />
        Have you ever been longing<br />
        For love and light<br />
        In a starry night

      <p>
        Someone told me we are all one<br />
        That we have known each other<br />
        Since it's all begun<br />
        That we are on a mission<br />
        Spreading love and light<br />
        In a star bright night
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is something making you sad<br />
        If you feel stuck in your bed<br />
        Then remember it is your choice<br />
        And follow your voice
      </p>
      <p>
        Some out there are doing just fine<br />
        Some out there are putting<br />
        Their lives on the line<br />
        Some out there are rich<br />
        And cool and super stars<br />
        Flying to mars
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe you're a regular guy<br />
        Maybe you're not stupid<br />
        Don't believe the hype<br />
        Maybe you are searching<br />
        For love and light<br />
        In a star bright night

      <p>
        And if you don't like what you've done<br />
        You can start all over again<br />
        Cause you're the only one in charge<br />
        If you follow your heart

        Partying on the shore<br />
        Having a glass of GinO<br />

        With velvet eyes<br />
        Being fresh and exiting<br />
        Sweet surprise

      <p>
        Used to name you for a number<br />

        Challenging my rules<br />
        It just feels like a love song<br />
        I don't know what it is<br />

        You are a silent beauty<br />
        With speaking eyes<br />
        You are so exiting

      <p>
        Sometimes think of you<br />
        Out of the blue<br />
        It seems as if our love was still alive<br />
        Remember all these words<br />
        We were two nerds<br />
        Our lives were torn away<br />
        We didn't stay on earth<br />
        It was a rebirth- yeah<br />
        And we were waking up<br />
        In a dream of love<br />
        Only stars above<br />
        Playing with a cloud<br />
        Our heartbeats were as loud
      </p>
      <p>
        As bass drums in a drum and bass track<br />
        When I look back<br />
        I feel magic love<br />
        A bass drum in a drum and bass track<br />
        Bass drums in a drum and bass track
      </p>
      <p>
        I know you had to go<br />
        I know you had to throw<br />
        Your feelings away<br />
        You couldn't stay with me<br />
        But I still see, I'm still dreaming<br />
        That ancient dream of you and me<br />
        In love, all the stars above playing<br />
        With a cloud<br />
        My heartbeat's still as loud
      </p>
      <p>
        As bass drums in a drum and bass track<br />
        When I look back I feel magic love<br />
        A bass drum in a drum and bass track<br />
        And now I look back<br />
        And I feel magic love<br />
        Bass drums in a drum and bass track

      <p>
        See you walking down the beach<br />
        Your bikini leaves me speechless<br />
        Feel the sun burn my skin<br />
        I think I gotta dive in the water<br />
        But I also feel I ought to ask you<br />
        For your number and your love<br />
        But wait, there's another one passing...
      </p>
      <p>
        Too many girls are crossing my way<br />
        Each and every day<br />
        How can I focus on one<br />
        So she'll become the one<br />
        That makes me forget about the rest
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe today I'll find the one<br />
        And my confusion will be gone<br />
        Maybe today I'll find a love
        And all I's ever
      </p>
      <p>
        Dreaming of<br />
        Will fall from the sky<br />
        And our love will make us fly<br />
        But right now another girl's passing by<br />
        And I'm feeling lonely<br />
        Watching bikinis

        You wanted your own song<br />
        But if you think I'll flatter you<br />
        Then you're so wrong again<br />
        I'll be honest instead
      </p>
      <p>
        I used to be your friend<br />
        Offered you a helping hand<br />
        But you couldn't appreciate<br />
        What I's prepared to do for you<br />
        And now we're thru girl
      </p>
      <p>
        Living in two worlds<br />
        Breathing the same air<br />
        But I just don't care anymore<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe there'll come a day<br />
        That will blow the smoke away<br />
        That made you disappear<br />
        From my view<br />
        And I will see your light again
      </p>
      <p>
        Who knows<br />
        How the wind blows<br />
        Golden leaves reminding me<br />
        Of who you used to be to me girl
      </p>
      <p>
        We're living in two worlds<br />
        Breathing the same air<br />
        And I don't care anymore

        I will never again be without you<br />
        Your flavor is in the air<br />
        Don't wanna miss a single day again<br />
        I have a chance with you to share
      </p>
      <p>
        How could I have been ignoring you<br />
        You've always been around<br />
        I've always been only a dark screen<br />
        You're the picture and the sound
      </p>
      <p>
        When we met I saw the sun rise<br />
        Golden rays warming my skin<br />
        You were showing me a perfect picture<br />
        And I was fitting in
      </p>
      <p>
        Talking to me straight from the universe<br />
        Telling me I'm not alone<br />
        Listening to your voice of love<br />
        Makes me feel I'm coming home
