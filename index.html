				SUNBEAMS

		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>
				We are dancing sunbeams<br>
				In the morning <br>
				Before we become<br>
				A bright blue sky<br>
				Sometimes I remember<br>
				Why I came here <br>
				Then I grow wings<br>
				And I get high
			</p>
			<p>
				And all my darkness<br>
				Is fading away <br>
				And I'm enjoying<br>
				A brand new day 
			</p>
			<p>
				Playing with sunbeams,<br>
				Dancing sunbeams
			</p>
			<p>
				We are running water<br>
				From the source to the sea <br>
				We're traveling a long way<br>
				But watch us from a plane-<br>
				We always stay
			</p>
			<p>
				When I see diamonds<br>
				Sparkle in the dark sky <br>
				Then I start dreaming<br>
				And I get high
			</p>
			<p>
				Playing with sunbeams,<br>
				Dancing sunbeams
			</p>
			<p>
				(melody)
			</p>
			<p>
				When I see diamonds<br>
				Sparkle all round the moon<br>
				Makes me feel happy<br>
				And I know I'll be soon
			</p>
			<p>
				Playing with sunbeams,<br>
				Dancing sunbeams

				In the morning <br>
				Before we become<br>
				A bright blue sky<br>
				Sometimes I remember<br>

				Only love will last<br>
				I will be with you<br>

				Now my days were boring<br>
				No one else to blame<br>
				My favorite picture<br>
				An empty frame

				But I can feel the sunshine<br>
				Smell the breeze<br>
				And if I make a wrong turn<br>

			<p>
				She was a quiet girl<br>
				Got never in trouble<br>
				And she loved her mother's heart<br>
				She went window shopping everyday<br>
				Something was missing<br>
				From the start
			</p>
			<p>
				So she grew into a beautiful blond<br>
				But there was darkness in her smile<br>
				When she grabbed the knife<br>
				A tear rolled down her cheek<br>
				There was moonlight in her eyes
			</p>

				Tina has never had a teddy bear<br>
				She is so sad, cries her eyes out<br>
				Tina has never had a teddy bear<br>

				Boys were dreaming<br>
				Of the beautiful girl<br>
				But her smile was a lie<br>

				I thought it was over<br>

				I've been blue<br>
				Didn't know what I was missing<br>
				But I've been missing you

				And in my darkest nights<br>
				You were with me<br>
				Cause you're my moonlight<br>
				The air I breathe
			</p>
			<p>
				So many places<br>
				Remind me of you<br>
				Wish I could face it<br> 
				Start something new
			</p>
			<p>
				But nothing seems worth it<br>
				Nothing seems real<br>
				A heart's been wounded<br> 
				It will be healed
			</p>
			<p>
				At the break of dawn<br>
				I'll wake from my dream<br>
				I will forgive you<br>
				And I'll be free
			</p>
			<p>

				And when the morning comes<br>

				The air I breathe
