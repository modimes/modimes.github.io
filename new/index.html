			SUNBEAMS
		</p>
		<p>
			We are dancing sunbeams<br>
			In the morning <br>
			Before we become<br>
			A bright blue sky<br>
			Sometimes I remember<br>
			Why I came here <br>
			Then I grow wings<br>
			And I get high
		</p>
		<p>
			And all my darkness<br>
			Is fading away <br>
			And I'm enjoying<br>
			A brand new day 
		</p>
		<p>
			Playing with sunbeams,<br>
			Dancing sunbeams
		</p>
		<p>
			We are running water<br>
			From the source to the sea <br>
			We're traveling a long way<br>
			But watch us from a plane-<br>
			We always stay
		</p>
		<p>
			When I see diamonds<br>
			Sparkle in the dark sky <br>
			Then I start dreaming<br>
			And I get high
		</p>
		<p>
			Playing with sunbeams,<br>
			Dancing sunbeams
		</p>
		<p>
			(melody)
		</p>
		<p>
			When I see diamonds<br>
			Sparkle all round the moon<br>
			Makes me feel happy<br>
			And I know I'll be soon
		</p>
		<p>
			Playing with sunbeams,<br>
			Dancing sunbeams
		</p>
		<p>
			We are dancing sunbeams<br>
			In the morning <br>
			Before we become<br>
			A bright blue sky<br>
			Sometimes I remember<br>
			Why I came here <br>
			Then I grow wings<br>
			And I get high

			Now my days were boring<br>
			No one else to blame<br>
